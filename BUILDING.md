# Forking & Branch Build
When you fork and create a branch and import into CLION right click on CMakeLists.txt and select Load/Reload CMake Project.
This will create the default debug build and include the source files in the project.

If the Reload CMake isn't an option do a file invalidate caches and this fixes the issue.
